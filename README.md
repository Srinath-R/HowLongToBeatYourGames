# HowLongToBeatYourGames
An app that fetches info on your games and provides features to view and sort games to generate to-play list.


## Dependencies

This project uses three third-party libraries:  
  
- requests
- flask
- howlongtobeatpy

## How it works?

After you save your games into games.py, press submit button in the web page. You will see a sortable table with your games and time-to-beat data. Response times depends on how much games you have.

## How do I install and run the app?

1. Clone the repo
2. Install the dependencies from requirements.txt. The versions might be old, refer to req.txt just in case. I could have retained just the req.txt but that seems to have unnecessary dependencies. I'd have to verify and get rid of either of them.
3. Run the app.py file
